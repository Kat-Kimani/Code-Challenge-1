THE SPEED CALCULATOR
DESCRIPTION
The code provided is a basic implementation of a speed detector using JavaScript & HTML

The HTML provides an input field for the user to enter the speed and a submit button that triggers the JavaScript code to calculate the number of demerit points, if the speed given is above the allowed 70KPH. It also goes ahead to advice whether the license should be suspended if the demerit points exceed 12points.

The JavaScript code includes an event listener that listens for a "click" event on the submit button. When the button is clicked, the code gets the input speed value entered by the user, converts it to an integer using parseInt(), and passes it to the speedCheck() function to calculate the number of demerit points or whether the license should be suspended.

The speedCheck() function uses a formula to calculate the demerit points and some conditional statements to determine the output.

Finally, the output is displayed on the web page using the document.getElementById() method to access the HTML element with the id "speed-id" and the append() method to add any text given in the final output to the element.

The code can be improved by adding error handling, better user interface design, and more features to enhance the functionality of the speed detector.
